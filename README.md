## Hey! I‚Äôm Larry, welcome to my page!  üëã

I am pursuing my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and (hopefully) EECS at UC Berkeley.
- ü§ñ My interests span multiple areas, namely at the intersection of Mechanics for Design, FEA/CFD, and materials with robotics, controls, optimization, and machine learning.
- Currently, my coursework in Fall 2024 includes:
  - **[MEC ENG 108: Mechanical Behavior of Engineering Materials](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2024-fall-meceng-108-001-lec-001)** taught by [Robert O. Ritchie](https://me.berkeley.edu/people/robert-o-ritchie/)
  - **[MEC ENG 103: Experimentation and Measurements](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2024-fall-meceng-103-001-lec-001)** taught by Professor [Hayden K. Taylor](https://me.berkeley.edu/people/hayden-taylor/)
  - **[EECS 127: Optimization Models in Engineering](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2024-fall-eecs-127-001-lec-001)** taught by Professor [Somayeh Sojoudi](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sojoudi/)
  - **[EL ENG 120: Signals and Systems](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2024-fall-eleng-120-001-lec-001)** taught by Professor [Kannan Ramchandran](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~kannanr/)
  - **[DATA 88E: Economic Models](https://data88e.org/)** taught by [Dr. Eric Van Dusen](https://cdss.berkeley.edu/people/eric-van-dusen)
  - **[MUSIC 168CS: Piano/Fortepiano Performance Studio](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/music-168cs)** taught by Professor [Jeffrey R. Sykes](https://music.berkeley.edu/people/jeffrey-sykes?page=1)

- My coursework in Spring 2024 will be:
  - **[COMPSCI 189/287A: Introduction to Machine Learning](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Courses/CS189/)** taught by Professor [Jonathan R. Shewchuck](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/)
  - **[MEC ENG 100: Electronics for the Internet of Things](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2025-spring-meceng-100-001-lec-001)** taught by [Dr. George Anwar](https://me.berkeley.edu/people/george-anwar/)
  - **[MEC ENG 104: Engineering Mechanics II](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2025-spring-meceng-104-001-lec-001)** taught by Professor [David J. Steigmann](https://me.berkeley.edu/people/david-steigmann/)
  - **[MEC ENG C180: Engineering Analysis using the Finite Element Method](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2025-spring-meceng-c180-001-lec-001)** taught by Professor [Tarek I. Zohdi](https://me.berkeley.edu/people/tarek-i-zohdi/)

- üë®‚Äçüíª For engineering implementation (Controls, Image Processing, Statistics, CVX, FEMLAB, etc.) I often use `.m`, `.slx`, and `.py` but am versed in `.java`, `.tex`, and `.cpp`
