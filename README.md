## Hey! I‚Äôm Larry, welcome to my page!  üëã

I am pursuing my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and (hopefully) EECS at UC Berkeley.
- My interests span multiple areas, namely at the intersection of Mechanics for Design, FEA/CFD, and materials with robotics, controls, optimization, and machine learning.
- Currently, my coursework in Fall 2024 includes:
  - **[MEC ENG 108: Mechanical Behavior of Engineering Materials](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2024-fall-meceng-108-001-lec-001)** with [Robert O. Ritchie](https://me.berkeley.edu/people/robert-o-ritchie/)
  - **[MEC ENG 103: Experimentation and Measurements](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2024-fall-meceng-103-001-lec-001)** with Professor [Hayden K. Taylor](https://me.berkeley.edu/people/hayden-taylor/)
  - **[EECS 127: Optimization Models in Engineering](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2024-fall-eecs-127-001-lec-001)** with Professor [Somayeh Sojoudi](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sojoudi/)
  - **[EL ENG 120: Signals and Systems](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2024-fall-eleng-120-001-lec-001)** with Professor [Kannan Ramchandaran](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~kannanr/)
  - **[DATA 88E: Economic Models](https://data88e.org/)** with [Dr. Eric Van Dusen](https://cdss.berkeley.edu/people/eric-van-dusen)
- üë®‚Äçüíª For engineering implementation (Controls, IP, CVX, FEMLAB, etc.) I often use `.m`, `.slx`, and `.py` but am versed in `.java`, and `.cpp`
